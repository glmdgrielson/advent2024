Advent of Code 2024
===================

It's that time of year again! Time to figure out how to code properly and solve
whimsical yet frustrating problems!

Per the creator's request, the input files are ***not*** included with this
repository, so you will have to supply your own.

## To Run This Code

1. Create the `src/input` directory.
2. Put the puzzle input in a text file named `dayXX.txt` where XX is replaced
   by the number of the day, with a zero added for the single digit days so
   that it sorts properly.
3. Run `cargo run --bin dayXX` with the same substitution.
4. The tests assume a similar file named `dayXX-test.txt` containing the sample
   data given in the text of the problem.
